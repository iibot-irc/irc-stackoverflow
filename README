IRC-Stackoverflow
-----------------

This script is intended to be invoked as a cronjob, and piped into an `ii`
instance.  It takes a stackoverflow tag and prints questions that are new
since it was last run (with the given state file).

This is pretty similar to irc-reddit so they could probably be generalized into
some sort of shared library.  Oh well.
